        <p>About</p>
        <p>
          As a teenager at school, I was the kid other students approached about
          issues with their phone or laptop. I was the go-to guy for fixing
          resolving any technical problems. Today, not much has changed. <br />
          I’m still the first point of call for technical issues. The difference
          is I now also develop innovative software to solve the problems of
          multinational companies. One of my most recent projects involved
          designing and rolling-out a new piece of software to optimise the
          efficiency of holiday bookings. <br />
          This contributed to a reduction in staff numbers and 12% increase in
          travel bookings. In my spare time, I manage a voluntary organisation
          called Butterfly, which aims to help young people get involved in
          technology. This involves training kids in software development and
          key technical processes. I also create PS4 games, one of which was
          voted as the best game of 2020 on over 10 websites.
